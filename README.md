# Food Classification using ResNet with PyTorch

This project focuses on food classification using the ResNet neural network architecture with PyTorch. Trained on the Food101 dataset, the model is capable of recognizing various food items with high accuracy. Leveraging the power of deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the project provides a technical solution for automated food recognition tasks.

## Technical Features

1. **ResNet Architecture:** The model utilizes the ResNet (Residual Neural Network) architecture, known for its deep layer structures and skip connections, which enable effective training of deep networks.
2. **Food Recognition:** Trained on the Food101 dataset, the model accurately recognizes various food items such as pizza, sushi, and more, providing both the class name and probability of recognition.
3. **Output Visualization:** In addition to classifying food items, the project provides visual outputs by applying transformations to the input images, enabling users to inspect the model's predictions alongside the original images.
4. **Data Download Method:** The code includes a method to download the Food101 dataset directly, eliminating the need for users to download and manage the dataset locally, thus enhancing convenience and usability.
5. **PyTorch Library:** The project heavily utilizes the PyTorch library, a popular deep learning framework known for its flexibility and ease of use, facilitating efficient model training and deployment.
